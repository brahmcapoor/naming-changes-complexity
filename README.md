Source code for an experiment I helped conduct as part of my internship at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke-NUS Medical School, Summer 2016

## The experiment
Details forthcoming!

## Running this

### OSX

**You must have [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) installed and set up.**

I use the awesome [Psychopy plugin for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/psychopy) to run this, but you can also just open whichever file you want to in the standalone Psychopy environment, and run it from there.


This has been tested and confirmed to work on a 13 inch Macbook Pro Retina running Mac OSX 10.11 El Capitan and a 24 inch 2013 iMac running Mac OSX 1.6 Snow Leopard connected to a 21 inch Lenovo Monitor, but I don't see any reason it shouldn't work on other systems. If you can figure out a way to run it on another system such that the csvs are generated (You might need to edit the dimensions of the screen), feel free to submit a pull request with a writeup. Submit an issue if you find a bug.
